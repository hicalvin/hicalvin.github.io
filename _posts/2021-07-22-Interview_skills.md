针对之前参加的一个面试方法的培训，做一个简单的总结。

- Traditional Interview
  - What's your greatest weakness?
  - Do you prefer to work alone or in teams?
  - Are you detail oriented?
- Pedigree and years of experience CANT predict success
  - 10 year of management?
  - Be a wild success at Google?
- Purpose of interview - Predict success in our team, by collecting evidence and compare with hiring criteria.
  - Get clarify on hiring criteria
  - Go deep, get evidence of performance
  - Look beyond traditional signals

    ```xml

    doing this kind of work, working in this culture?

    - Walk me through the system/process/program you build at ...
    - Please tell me about a time you used *X* to achieve *Y* (How, Why, What)
  - Bad questions:
    - Are you good at X? oh great

    - How would you diagnose that problem?
    - What information would you need?
    - Where would you get that?
    - How would you rule out things that are unlikely root issues?

    - What was the problem?
    - How did you traditionally solve a problem like that?
    - Why didn't that work in this situation?
    - What solution worked?
    - Who else worked with you on that situation?
    - Did it work? How do you know? What did you learn?
