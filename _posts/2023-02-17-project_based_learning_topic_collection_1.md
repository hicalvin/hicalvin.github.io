## Proposal 1

### Project Title: "Around the World in 7 Days"

Project Overview: In this project, the student will learn about different countries around the world and their unique cultures, while practicing math and language skills. The project will be completed over the course of one week.

Day 1: Introduction to the project

Introduce the project to the student and explain that they will be learning about different countries around the world.
Discuss the different aspects of culture that make each country unique (e.g. food, music, language, traditions).
Provide the student with a blank passport booklet that they will fill in throughout the week.
Day 2: Geography

Introduce the concept of maps and globes and explain how they represent the Earth.
Provide the student with a blank world map and have them label the continents and oceans.
Choose one country to focus on (e.g. Japan) and have the student locate it on the map.
Discuss the location of the country in relation to other countries and continents.
Have the student fill in the "Country Facts" page in their passport booklet with information about the country's location, capital city, and population.
Day 3: Math

Introduce the concept of currency and exchange rates.
Choose a country that uses a different currency than the student's home country (e.g. Japan) and explain the exchange rate.
Provide the student with a budget (e.g. $50) and have them research the cost of various items in the country (e.g. a meal, a souvenir).
Have the student use math skills to convert the prices from the local currency to their home currency and determine how much they can buy with their budget.
Have the student fill in the "Currency Conversion" page in their passport booklet.
Day 4: Language

Introduce the language spoken in the country chosen for the project (e.g. Japanese).
Teach the student basic phrases in the language (e.g. hello, thank you, please).
Have the student practice writing the phrases in the language and use them in context (e.g. ordering food at a restaurant).
Have the student fill in the "Language" page in their passport booklet with the phrases they learned.
Day 5: Culture

Have the student research and learn about one aspect of the culture and create a presentation or drawing to share with the class.
Have the student fill in the "Culture" page in their passport booklet with information about the aspect of the culture they learned about.
Day 6: Review

Review the information learned throughout the week and have the student share their passport booklet with the class.
Quiz the student on the information learned (e.g. asking them to locate a country on the map, identify a phrase in the language, or convert currency).
Encourage the student to ask questions and share any additional information they learned throughout the week.
Day 7: Reflection

Have the student reflect on what they learned throughout the week and what they enjoyed most about the project.
Have the student fill in the "Reflection" page in their passport booklet with their thoughts and feelings about the project.
Provide the student with a certificate of completion for their hard work and dedication throughout the week.
This project-based lesson incorporates geography, math, and language while allowing the student to explore and learn about different cultures around the world. It also encourages critical thinking and problem-solving skills while providing a fun and engaging learning experience.
