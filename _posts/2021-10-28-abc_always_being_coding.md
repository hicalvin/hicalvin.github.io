This is such a [GREAT github repo](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university) by sharing all the content from John to parepare the interview of programming then successfully became an Engineer of Amazon.

With 196k star, 8.4k watch and 52.7k fork as of now. As he said, this was planed just a to-do list of study topcis, but now it's get such a valuable resource for new software engineers. To do one normal thing in a extreme way will make the whole thing completedly not normal.

As what wechat mentioned, after visiting John's repo, he turned sleepless that night. I totally agree.

For coding, I should start doing something before ending 2021.

### Start from Algorithm

- [x] Harvard CS50 - Asymptotic Notation(video)
- [x] Big O Natations (general quick tutorial) (video)
  - [Intro to Big O Notation and Time Complexity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6xkbGLQesk). :thumbsup: for this video, explained all the stuffs in math.
    - How to idenify
            1. find the fastest growing term
            2. take out the coefficient
    - Time complexity
      - linear time O(n)
      - constant time O(1)
      - quadratic time O(n^2)
