This is such a [GREAT github repo](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university) by sharing all the content from John to parepare the interview of programming then successfully became an Engineer of Amazon.

With 196k star, 8.4k watch and 52.7k fork as of now. As he said, this was planed just a to-do list of study topcis, but now it's get such a valuable resource for new software engineers. To do one normal thing in a extreme way will make the whole thing completedly not normal.

As what wechat mentioned, after visiting John's repo, he turned sleepless that night. I totally agree.

For coding, I should start doing something before ending 2021.
