昨天跟ChatGPT聊了差不多半天时间，包括看了些关于它的原理的视频，大概知道了它擅长的地方。今天就让ChatGPT试试干点正事 -- 做旅游攻略。从德国慕尼黑开始的一次自驾，不知道它会做出个什么样的东西呢？

首先，我把我想要途径的城市都一股脑告诉它，看看它能不能出个比较合理的计划。

基本上是按照我给的城市顺序加到了行程中，并且还推荐了一些城市景点，总的来说还不错。我想印证一下它对路程的合理性的智能，所以把城市顺序打乱，结果它还是按照我列出城市的顺序给出了规划，而且它还给了路程的时间。看起来挺智能，但只要去地图上看一下就知道根本不合理。也可以原谅，毕竟它的强项在于语言生成，对于物理上路程的远近并不在它的能力范围内。

我的本意是想增加每个城市的时间，结果它直接把15天安排给了15个城市，依旧秉承一天一个城市的规划，所以增加了斯洛文尼亚、克罗地亚、奥地利、匈牙利甚至捷克的城市。这....也算是一种玩法吧。

既然它没办法智慧的增加每个城市的游览时间，那我就一个个来问吧。

如果不限定只在慕尼黑，它又开始把周边城市给规划进来了，所以加个 **Only** 。

整个使用下来，我觉得ChatGPT对于文字的理解和结果的呈现都相对还是比较合理的，目前来看作为一个规划助手勉强算是够用，不过对于结果还是要增加二次验证才能确保真正能用。 

有了这次试用，基本上可以认定ChatGPT在日常使用中能承担查询、文字组织的工作，已经可以很好的增加生产力了。
