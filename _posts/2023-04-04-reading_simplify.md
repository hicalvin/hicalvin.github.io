The book of <Simplify> was written by Richard Koch.  Richard Koch is a British author, investor, and entrepreneur who has written several books on business and personal development, including "The 80/20 Principle" and "Simplify." He advocates for the use of the 80/20 principle, which suggests that 80% of results come from 20% of effort, and that focusing on the most important 20% can lead to significant improvements in productivity and success. Additionally, he emphasizes the importance of simplifying one's life and business, getting rid of unnecessary complexity and focusing on what truly matters.

Over the last 40 years Richard Koch has worked to uncover the simple principles and strategies behind every successful business. With the help of venture capitalist Greg Lockwood and supported by research from OC&C Strategy Consultants, Koch has uncovered the one uniting principle behind successful companies such as IKEA, the Boston Consulting Group, Honda, and Uber: Simplify.

Taking the principle one step further, Koch has identified that companies will either be **price simplifiers**—consider flying a budget airline stripped of all the extras that still takes you from point A to point B—or **proposition simplifiers**—such as Apple with their easy-to-use products for a large market willing to pay a premium.

In this book, Koch and Lockwood dissect case studies to share the secrets behind the great simplifiers of business. You’ll learn how to:
• Decide which simplifying strategy is the best option for your business
• Model your business as a price or proposition simplifier
• Make your products and services more useful and better looking
• Spike demands and create markets that didn’t exist before
• Redesign your business process and transform your industry in nine steps
• Implement the three fundamental principles to sparking a price revolution

Richard Koch's book "Simplify" offers a clear and accessible guide to the core principles of business success in some of the world's most famous companies. Through case studies and historical analysis, he explores how companies can succeed by simplifying their pricing strategies and value propositions.

One of the book's strengths is its practical guidance for decision-makers. Koch offers clear advice on how to determine the most effective simplification strategy for a given business, based on factors such as target market and product design.

One key takeaway from the book is the importance of designing products that are tailored to the target market. For example, if a company wants to make a product like the Ford automobile affordable for the majority of consumers, they need to focus on standardization and ease of production. On the other hand, if a company is pursuing a proposition simplification approach, they may want to prioritize factors like ease of use or coolness, even at the expense of cost.

Overall, "Simplify" is a valuable resource for anyone looking to understand how businesses can simplify and succeed in today's competitive market.
