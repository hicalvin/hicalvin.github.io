## 战争与灾难

是德国挑起的一战吗？ 不能说是，而是几个大国共同的责任。

> Prompt: Which country started World War I ?
>
> The outbreak of World War I is typically traced back to the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary by a Bosnian-Serb nationalist in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, on June 28, 1914. This event set off a chain of events that eventually led to the declaration of war between the Central Powers, led by Germany and Austria-Hungary, and the Allied Powers, led by France, Russia, and the United Kingdom.
> 
> However, it is worth noting that the causes of World War I were complex and multi-faceted, and cannot be solely attributed to a single event or country. Long-term factors such as nationalism, imperialism, and military alliances, as well as short-term factors such as a breakdown in diplomacy, also played a role in the outbreak of the war.

1914年，奥匈皇储在萨拉热窝被塞尔维亚民族主义者刺杀，成为一战导火索，从暗杀到大战爆发的一个月被成为七月危机。然后，被他刺杀的奥匈皇储，实际上是奥匈高层最主张给境内斯拉夫人平等地位的，也是最主要的反战派。 于是奥匈主战派摆脱约束，指控塞尔维亚幕后策划暗杀，发起战争

奥匈是德国唯一的盟国，同时德国处于法国、英国、俄国的包围之中。奥匈寻求德国支持，德国只能答应，并且德国选择无条件支持盟友。

奥匈大塞尔维亚，塞的后台俄国就回去打奥匈，所以德国就要参战，德国支持奥匈，所以俄国打德国，而德国只有一个计划 -- 施利芬计划，无论仗从哪里开始，都要先摧毁法国。

经过一战四年的战术死磕，德意志帝国最终崩溃，迎来了一个风雨飘摇的共和国 --- 魏玛共和国


### 魏玛共和国为什么失败

从1871年统一到今天，德国经历了

- 德意志帝国
- 魏玛共和国
- NZ德国 (第三帝国)
- 东西德分裂
- 重新统一的联邦德国

魏玛共和国

- 右派觉得软弱
- 左派觉得反动
- 后来的人觉得它要为NZ上台负责

### 魏玛共和国怎么来的

一战打了四年再也打不下去了， 1918年11月德国爆发革命，皇帝退位。中间派牵头组织政府，1919年正式成立共和国，因为新的宪法是在德国小城魏玛制定的，所以也叫魏玛共和国。

特点：

- 在战败和革命的背景下匆忙成立
- 政治力量是中间派，左右两派都攻击

一战的影响
- 《凡尔赛条约》对德国非常苛刻，所有的海外殖民地被战胜国瓜分，割地赔款。在德国人看来，《凡尔赛条约》就是一个丧权辱国的卖国条约。
- 最后停火的时候战线都在别的国家，战场上没失败
- 1923年 德国恶性通货膨胀
- 1929年 美国股市崩盘开始的大萧条

> ChatGPT: The Weimar Republic lasted only a relatively short time, from 1919 to 1933, due to a number of factors. Some of the main reasons include:
> 
> Economic instability: The Weimar Republic inherited a devastated economy after World War I, with high inflation, widespread poverty, and widespread unemployment.
> 
> Political instability: The Weimar Republic was plagued by political instability, with frequent changes of government, which made it difficult to implement reforms and build a stable government.
> 
> Weaknesses in the Constitution: The Weimar Constitution was seen as weak by many, as it failed to establish a clear system of government or provide a strong central authority, leaving Germany in a state of political fragmentation.
> 
> The rise of extremist groups: The Weimar Republic was marked by the rise of extremist groups, such as the Nazis, who opposed democracy and the Weimar government.
>
> Lack of support from other countries: The Weimar Republic was also hampered by a lack of support from other countries, especially France and Britain, who imposed harsh peace terms on Germany after World War I.
> 
> All of these factors contributed to the decline of the Weimar Republic and the rise of Nazi Germany.

魏玛共和国做成的事情
1. 维护国家统一
2. 解决就业问题

### NZ为什么上台

- NZ党只用了12年时间，从刚成立的几十个人变成德国国会第一大党
- NZ掌权后几个月，魏玛共和国消亡，德国进入所谓的"第三帝国"

- 凡尔赛条约对德国苛刻，德国人心里积压仇恨，加上魏玛共和国不是一个强有力的监护人，德国国家主义传统有非常强大。
- 国家越动荡，NZ党对民众的吸引力就越大

Hitler 为什么能蛊惑国人？因为抓住了德国人的痛点

- 复仇，废除《凡尔赛和约》
- 反犹
  - 一方面德国和其他有些欧洲国家一样有反犹主义的根子，主要来源于基督教和犹太教的矛盾
  - 德国中产阶级遭遇通胀和大萧条，从而对金融资本产生了很大的恐惧和仇恨，而犹太人在金融界又那么出名
  - 德国中上层恐惧共产主义，而德国的共产主义革命的领导人中，好几个都是犹太人

> Prompt: Why  Adolf Hitler got support from Germans？
> ChatGPT: Adolf Hitler was able to gain support from many Germans for several reasons:
> 
> Economic conditions: Germany was facing significant economic challenges in the aftermath of World War I, including high unemployment and inflation. Hitler promised to restore prosperity and national pride, which resonated with many Germans who were struggling financially.
> 
> Political instability: The Weimar Republic was weakened by political infighting and instability, and many Germans were frustrated with the government and the Treaty of Versailles. Hitler offered a clear and simple solution to these problems and promised to restore order and stability.
>
> Propaganda: The Nazi Party was skilled at using propaganda to spread their ideas and promote Hitler as a charismatic leader. The media, including newspapers, radio, and film, were all controlled by the party and used to manipulate public opinion.
> 
> Nationalism: Hitler was able to tap into a deep sense of nationalism and feelings of resentment among Germans who felt that their country had been humiliated and mistreated after World War I. He promised to restore German pride and reclaim the country's place as a world power.
>
> Fear: The Nazi regime used violence, intimidation, and propaganda to control the population and suppress dissent. People who spoke out against the government were often arrested, imprisoned, or killed, which helped to create a climate of fear and silence any opposition.

1933年2月国会纵火案并不是NZ德国的开始，而是1933年3月21日，德国国会以超过三分之二的法定多数通过了著名的"授权法案"，也就是《消除人民和国家痛苦法》
1. 国会的立法职能交给政府内阁，实际上国会就没有了
2. 政府内阁必要时可以背离宪法，实际上宪法也没有了

### NZ德国"经济奇迹"到底是什么

- "消灭失业" - 推出大规模的公共基建项目，特别是全国高速公路网建设
- "婚姻贷款"

国家的钱从哪里来？ 沙赫特协定 -- 进原料，出口成品; 财政赤字； 掠夺犹太人财富

- "水晶之夜" - 实际上是全国性的破坏、抢劫犹太教堂和犹太人的店铺和家庭，因为到处都是砸破的玻璃，所以叫做"水晶之夜"。之后NZ政府直接没收犹太人的财产。

> ChatGPT: The Nazi Party, led by Adolf Hitler, came to power in Germany in 1933, and they were able to create the appearance of an "economic miracle" in the country during the 1930s. Here are some factors that contributed to this illusion of prosperity:
> 
> Public Works Projects: The Nazi government invested heavily in public works projects, such as highways, bridges, and buildings, which created jobs and boosted the construction industry.
> 
> Military spending: The Nazi regime increased military spending, which created jobs in the armaments industry and helped to stimulate the economy.
>
> Full Employment: Hitler made full employment a top priority, and he implemented policies that helped to reduce unemployment. For example, he created government-sponsored programs to provide work for the unemployed, such as the Reich Labor Service.
>
> Price controls: The Nazi government implemented strict price controls, which kept the cost of living low and helped to improve the standard of living for many Germans.
>
> Credit expansion: The Nazi regime also expanded credit, which allowed for increased spending and investment in the economy.
> 
> It's important to note that the Nazi regime's policies were not sustainable and were based on a number of false assumptions. The military buildup and the eventual outbreak of World War II placed a heavy strain on the economy, and by the end of the war, Germany was left in ruins. The so-called "economic miracle" was short-lived and came at a great cost to the German people and the world.

### 为什么德军在二战中那么能打

1939年德国进攻破烂，正式发动第二次世界大战。这是人类历史上强度最大、灾难最重的一场战争。

德军人数没有对手多，武器装备也不占优势，先进的坦克都是战争后期才出来，而且产量一直没上去，为什么德军伤亡少，那么能打？答案之一是因为德国人军事思想先进，创造性的把坦克、装甲车集中使用，搞出一种新的作战模式 -- 闪电战。但这个原因没法解释德国转入防御之后的优胜。德军之所以在二战如此强悍，得益于系统效能。

德军在一战结束和二战开始之间的二十年，德军内部的反思提高是德军战斗力飞跃的真正原因。反思肯定了德军的大框架，同时改变了：
1. 人与人之间的关系 - 官兵一致；战场上军官身先士卒
2. 重新强化德国军事传统。 委托式指挥。交代下级只讲目标，不讲方式，充分放权
3. 战法上的改变  《闪电战的根源》  by James Corum

> ChatGPT: There were several factors that contributed to the strength of the German military during World War II:
> 
> Doctrine: The German military had a well-defined doctrine that emphasized the importance of mobility, flexibility, and the use of combined arms. This doctrine, known as Blitzkrieg, allowed the German military to rapidly overcome its enemies and capture territory quickly.
> 
> Training: The German military was well-trained, and its soldiers were known for their discipline and tactical proficiency. The German military also placed a strong emphasis on physical fitness and marksmanship, which gave its soldiers a significant advantage in combat.
> 
> Equipment: The German military was equipped with some of the most advanced weapons and equipment of the time, including tanks, aircraft, and artillery. The quality of these weapons was often superior to those of the German's enemies, and they gave the German military a significant advantage on the battlefield.
> 
> Leadership: The German military was led by experienced and competent officers, many of whom had served in World War I. These leaders were able to effectively plan and execute complex military operations, and they were able to inspire their troops and maintain high morale.
> 
> Strategic planning: The German military made effective use of intelligence and strategic planning, and it was often able to surprise its enemies and achieve rapid victories. The German military was also able to effectively coordinate its various branches, including the army, air force, and navy, to achieve its objectives.
> 
> Overall, these factors helped to make the German military one of the most powerful and effective fighting forces of World War II. However, it's important to note that the German military eventually suffered defeat, and the war took a heavy toll on the country and its people.

### 德国为什么成为冷战地标

战后德国面临的前景是：要么保持统一，要么干脆肢解成几个小国家。一分为二基本没有人预料到。

二战后，德国被四国瓜分，分别是美苏英法。东西方冷战，首要目标是不能让德国落入对方手中，一个统一的德国，会瞬间改变东西方两大阵营的力量对比。从美苏角度来说，这是个巨大的风险。无论从德国的潜力和地理位置来说，都决定了它不能统一，只能分裂。
但分裂成多个小国不符合美苏对抗的考虑，因为德国的那部分实力对两边来说都是重要的增量。确保自己手里的那部分德国尽可能是一个整体。

联邦德国第一任总理阿登纳宁愿接受分裂，因为他知道在东西方对立的情况下，德国如果坚持统一就一定要被迫选边，保持分裂，可以保持联邦德国获得西方的帮助。

阿登纳的决定，更加长远的影响是让德国开始把自己并入西方世界，而不再是东西方混合体。
