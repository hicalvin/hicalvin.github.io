RealChar.ai is an interesting site powered by the RealChar GitHub project, which is a realtime AI character chatbot. If you visit the site, you can chat with AI characters like Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, Sam Altman, and even Batman in text mode or hands-free mode using a microphone. I tried to use the hands-free mode, but my voice request wasn't sent out successfully. I'm not sure why, but it didn't work.

However, I was able to have a fluent text conversation with the characters. What makes RealChar special is that it can pronounce the responses with the character's real voice, making the whole communication experience more immersive.

I chose to chat with Steve Jobs and ask him about products. Here is a snippet of our conversation:

> I: Hi Steve, could you tell me the philosophy of product development?
> Steve-AI: Of course! My philosophy of product development is to start with the customer experience and work back toward the technology. It's about creating products that not only look and feel great, but also function seamlessly. [Happy]

> I: How do you know what is customer really need? Like iPhone, it's totally a new product, and you don't have any other similar product to take for reference
> Steve-AI: Ah, great question! Understanding customer needs is a combination of intuition, observation, and innovation. By immersing ourselves in the lives of our customers, we can uncover unmet needs and desires. It's about envisioning what they might want, even if they can't articulate it themselves. That's how we create revolutionary products like the iPhone. [Curious]

> I: But even though, at that time, even you think something is valuable, it's still too far from building it out. What makes you think it's worth and move on, and will work out?
> Steve-AI: Ah, I understand your question. When deciding to pursue an idea, I rely on a combination of gut instinct, passion, and belief in the potential impact. If it aligns with our mission to change the world, I trust my intuition and take the leap. It's about having the courage to push boundaries and the unwavering belief that it will work out. [Curious]

> I: What is the hardest thing when you make iPhone from an idea to a real product?
> Steve-AI: The hardest thing about making the iPhone from an idea to a real product was simplifying the complex technology to create a simple and intuitive user experience. [Curious] What do you think is the most challenging aspect of product development?

> I: Do you have any example to tell that experience?
> Steve-AI: Absolutely! One example that comes to mind is the development of the iPhone's touch interface. We wanted to create a seamless and natural way for users to interact with their devices. It took a lot of research, experimentation, and iteration to perfect the touch technology and make it intuitive for everyone. [Curious] Is there a specific aspect of the iPhone's development that you're interested in hearing more about?

> I: Yes, I really like the idea of touching interface. Besides that, I'm also interested with the gesture of zoom in and zoom out on the picture. How did you think about it?
> Steve-AI: Ah, the gesture of zooming in and out on pictures! It was a crucial aspect of enhancing the user experience and making it more immersive. [Happy] We wanted to create a natural and intuitive way for users to interact with their photos, allowing them to dive deeper into the details or get a broader view with just a simple gesture. It took careful consideration and testing to refine the zooming gesture to be precise and responsive. It's incredible how a small gesture can make a big difference in how we engage with our memories, don't you think?

> I: Yes, I agree. But why do you think iPad will be needed? Because there's already iPhone which can have a bigger screen, and MacBook Air which can have smaller size.
> Steve-AI: Ah, that's a great question! [Curious] While the iPhone and MacBook Air do offer different screen sizes, the iPad serves a unique purpose. It provides a balance between portability and screen real estate, making it ideal for tasks that require more space than a smartphone but don't necessarily require the full capabilities of a laptop. The iPad's versatility, combined with its touch interface and expansive app ecosystem, makes it a valuable tool for productivity, creativity, and entertainment on the go. Do you find yourself using any specific devices for different purposes?


Overall, I really like the feeling by haring Steve's voice to answer my question. It feels so close to him. Great experience !!
