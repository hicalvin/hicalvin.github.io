## 英语

> How to define the different level of EFL  and give some examples
> EFL (English as a Foreign Language) proficiency can be defined using various proficiency levels, such as the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). The CEFR defines six levels of language proficiency from A1 (beginner) to C2 (advanced).
> 
> Here are the CEFR proficiency levels and some examples of what students at each level are typically able to do:
>
>A1 (Beginner): Students can understand and use familiar, everyday expressions and very basic phrases to meet concrete needs.
Example: Students can introduce themselves and ask simple questions about personal details, such as where they are from, their age, and what they do.
> 
> A2 (Elementary): Students can understand sentences and frequently used expressions related to areas of most immediate relevance (e.g., basic personal and family information, shopping, local geography, employment).
Example: Students can describe their daily routines, ask for and give directions, and talk about their hobbies and interests.
> 
> B1 (Intermediate): Students can understand the main points of clear standard input on familiar matters regularly encountered in work, school, leisure, etc.
Example: Students can describe their experiences and express opinions on a variety of topics, such as their travel experiences, favorite foods, and personal goals.
> 
> B2 (Upper-Intermediate): Students can understand the main ideas of complex text on both concrete and abstract topics, including technical discussions in their field of specialization.
Example: Students can give detailed descriptions and arguments on a range of topics, such as social issues, current events, and cultural practices.
> 
> C1 (Advanced): Students can understand a wide range of demanding, longer texts, and recognize implicit meaning.
Example: Students can engage in complex interactions on a range of academic and professional topics, such as business negotiations, scientific research, and literary analysis.
>
> C2 (Mastery): Students can understand with ease virtually everything heard or read, and can summarize information from different spoken and written sources.
Example: Students can speak and write fluently and accurately in a wide range of contexts, including academic and professional settings.

> Any lower level before A1?
> 
> Yes, there are some lower levels of English proficiency that precede A1 on the CEFR scale. While these levels are not officially recognized by the CEFR, they are sometimes used to describe the earliest stages of language learning. Here are a few examples:
> 
> Pre-A1: This level is used to describe learners who are just starting to learn English and may not yet be able to understand or produce any English words or phrases.
>
> A0 (Breakthrough): This level is used to describe learners who have just started learning English and can understand and use very basic words and phrases, such as greetings, numbers, and simple questions and answers.
> 
> Starter: This level is used to describe learners who are just beginning to learn English and can understand and use a limited range of simple vocabulary and structures, such as basic nouns, verbs, and pronouns.

One day, Hanghang and Zhouzhou saw a pretty butterfly. The butterfly was yellow and flew past a purple flower. The butterfly then flew to an orange flower and sat on it. Next, the butterfly saw a brown bird on a branch. It kept flying and saw a pink rose bush. Finally, it landed on a blue flower. Hanghang and Zhouzhou loved seeing all the beautiful colors.
