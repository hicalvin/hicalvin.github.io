## What is Platform Engineering

> Platform engineering is the discipline of designing and building toolchains and workflows that enable self-service capabilities for software engineering organizations in the cloud-native era. Platform engineers provide an integrated product most often referred to as an “Internal Developer Platform” covering the operational necessities of the entire lifecycle of an application.

Many articles published during the mid year of 2022 talking about Platform Engineering, and most of them also say it's based on the ashes of DevOps. Platform Engineering will take platform as a product, will be like **Internal Developer Platform(IDP)**. 

> Platform engineers provide an integrated product most often referred to as an “Internal Developer Platform” covering the operational necessities of the entire lifecycle of an application. An Internal Developer Platform (IDP) is a layer on top of the tech and tooling an engineering team has in place already. It helps operations structure their setup and enable developer self-service. Platform engineering done right means providing **golden paths** and paved roads that match the preferred abstraction level of the individual developer, who interacts with the IDP layer.

> Platform engineering implements reusable tools and self-service capabilities with automated infrastructure operations, improving the developer experience and productivity. 
> This technology approach utilizes reusable configurable application components and services.
> The benefit to users is in standardized tools, components and automated processes.

- Few key principles to build an IDP
  - Must store changes to Git
  - Must use Git as the source of the desired state
  - Must have a universal API
  - Must be a universal control plan
